### ✅ What I'm looking for
I'm looking to employ my decade of experience in web development as a lead engineer, navigating teams through both technical challenges and external demands. I seek a role where both code contribution and developer mentorship are necessary, as I enjoy technical solutions and coaching junior developers. Most importantly, I'm looking to push the web development industry forward by solving tough problems using things like *finite state machines* (I'm one of those guys!).

***If this is your team, keep reading! 👍***

### 🛑 What I'm not looking for
I am not looking for a management position, nor to spend most of my time in meetings. I am not seeking a solely maintenance or bugfixing engineer role. I am not interested in having limited technical input for projects. I am not looking to join a culture where feedback is unwelcome or where learning is impossible.

***If this is your team, perhaps we are not a good fit. 👋***

## 📚 Experience

### Senior Software Engineer - *CarMax*
##### 📆 June 2017 - Present	📍 Richmond, VA
I was hired as part of a team that enabled CarMax to sell cars online. So far I have contributed to two of the most vital teams within CarMax:
- **MyCarMax team** - built UI & APIs for user-specific interaction, such as vehicle order status, saved cars, saved searches, profile information, and more. This can be thought of as the user's homepage or dashboard. I consider this team at the epicenter of CarMax micro-services as it consumes many dozens of other teams' APIs.
- **Checkout team** - responsible for progressing a user through the car-buying process, ranging from retrieving vehicle history reports, guiding a user through selling their vehicle to CarMax, filing financing applications & returning results, warranty selections, and so on. This is a large codebase with complex needs that also relies on consuming dozens of micro-services. I thoroughly pushed our mock services & end-to-end testing here, as this experience is critical to CarMax making money.

- **Front-end responsibilities:**
	- Collaborate with designer on new features & to uphold (or correct) design system standards
	- Advise project management on proper technical scope & breakdown of work for junior developers
	- Build it, test it, ship it!
	- Contribute to internal open source initiatives, such as design system libraries
	- Solely responsible for front-end

- **Back-end responsibilities:**
	- Build & maintain DotNet API which aggregates numerous micro-services for a front-end app (which I call a BFF, or "back-end-for-front-end")
	- Work with other internal teams to specify micro-service interfaces
	- Monitor Azure Dev Ops for cost & uptime
	- Not solely responsible
#### 🎖 Notable achievements:
- Obtained patent (US-11170424-B1) for a feature made with my team that allowed a user to (theoretically) save any car across the web into their own MyCarMax account.
- Converted two large (and somewhat legacy) front-end codebases to TypeScript to make development simpler and catch bugs before users do.
- Primary instructor & curriculum contributor for all internal front-end development lessons at CarMax

>**✍️ Skills:** TypeScript • React • Jest • C# • DotNet • Azure Dev Ops • Browserstack • Playwright • "micro-services"

### Creative Engineer - *Purple, Rock, Scissors*
##### 📆 Mar 2015 - May 2017 📍 Orlando, FL
At Purple, Rock, Scissors, I deigned, developed and maintained original web properties for our numerous clients - ranging from local restaurants to national healthcare providers and even major social media giants. These web properties were often custom dynamic websites built around Wordpress or Drupal. In addition to being a technical resource, I worked closely with my project managers and often directly assisted clients as a technical consultant. I excelled at handling shifting business requirements as well as working under pressure and meeting deadlines.

#### 🎖 Notable achievements:
- Designed, illustrated & developed email templates for LinkedIn's premium benefits - a campaign to convert free users to premium users
- Convinced the entire development team to adopt a single git flow strategy across the organization. We switched projects frequently, so having standardized version control was vital.
- Contributed automation scripts for project setup & development using task managers like gulp.js and virtual machines like vagrant - frequent personnel switches meant onboarding & project setup was a big time sink.

>**✍️ Skills:**  HTML • CSS • SASS • Javascript • JQuery • Vagrant • Wordpress • MySQL • PHP • LAMP/LEMP stack • UX/UI design • Gulp

### Front-End Designer & Developer - *Ascentus*
##### 📆 Feb 2013 - Feb 2015 📍 Orlando, FL

I was initially hired as an illustrator to provide content for our web properties. I quickly expanded into front-end development, as I saw a need for our small team of 5. I took the initiative to learn more about web technology, and eventually became front-end developers over the course of my 2 year employment.

#### 🎖 Notable achievements:
- Self-taught front-end development immediately upon hiring, began contributing on first month
- Adopted & faithfully implemented design & development standards set forth by senior team members
